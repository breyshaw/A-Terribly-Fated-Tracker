# A Terribly Fated Tracker

A Terribly Fated Tracker is a Majora's Mask inspired web application that assists in obtaining all of the masks in Nintendo's legendary dark sequel to Ocarina of Time. The application is Full-Stack, Full-CRUD, Mobile Responsive, and features amazing work by the talented texture artist, Henkriko Magnifico (see credits below.)

Visit the site [here](https://a-terribly-fated-tracker.herokuapp.com/).

## Motivation: 
I have played this game for years and always used my official players guide as a reference to get all the masks in the game. I am working in a new framework and language, Django and Python. Creating an app for a game that I love has been a blast and it was the best way for me to learn.

## Planning:

Check out my [trello](https://trello.com/b/xCPtrTCm/a-terribly-fated-tracker)! Laying out all of this information was very beneficial in the process of creating the web applicaiton.


Here are a few screenshots of the app, post styling and functionality:

A Terribly Fated Tracker is a Full Stack Django and Python built application. Users are able to signup to create an account with Django's built in auth, they can perform full crud on their "Save Files" which are the game inventory trackers themselves. AWS image uploading functionality was implemented and is only allowed for the user that is admin.. me! I used it securely upload Henriko's awesome Mask Textures.

## Technology Implemented:

## Stretch Goals:

<p></p>
Add the same functionality but for Items!
<p></p>
Add video walkthroughs for each mask details page (I have already created an URL attribute for this in my mask model)

Potential to evolve this app into A Terribly Fated Guide. Story and dungeon walkthroughs etc.

All the credit goes to Henriko Magnifico for creating such an amazing retexture of Majora's Mask. I used his Majora's Mask 4K texture pack in this application with permission from Henriko himself. If reliving your childhood dreams in really good HD graphics sounds fun to you, check out this site:
